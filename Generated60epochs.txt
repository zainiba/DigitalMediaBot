Contemporary discussion to all who sympathize would spend their time on such a tedious video game? It seems an ironic gesture that the real world white-collar players are so controlled and subdued that they would never dream of rebellion within this virtual white-collar world. Even the most radical actions they can consider will lead them nowhere. Their only option is suicide, which many of their colleagues have already chosen. Every Day the Same Dream fails to pose any critical commentary on contemporary life. The video game introduces nothing to its players with which they do not already agree. It is a reckless perpetuation of the imagined in living, growing matter. Additionally, the ventilated light-box serves to draw a small, meager thing, stunted, impoverished, a bare winter-tree with no foliage at the virtual and the geophysical world. Instead of integrating games into reality, as with gamification has started to take shape with possibilities, now slowly being animated with the content of ear

Examples of this emergent pattern happening within the pattern still contains within itself any number of bifurcating sub-programs that modulate itself into a symbol of transcendence, one that is inevitably produced by the capitalist society focused on the consumer."

Fittingly, the process and design of the pattern became much more contextual reference to computational art; the generative display of screen-based Mare from social concerns for local community and users to environmental responsiveness.

The pleasure from these things. Despite humanity s best attempts to segregate and becoming a truism, it bears repeating: there is a seemingly infinite amount of squandered potential in video games. Everyone seems to acknowledge this, but almost no one is doing anything to approach that potential, either because they are paralyzed by financial necessities, enjoy creating meaningless paracosms that satisfy mainstream tastes, or are stuck in the past, making video games that prostrate themselves in front of their non-interactive artistic predecessors.
